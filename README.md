## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/Higangssh/homebutler@latest

# Or download from releases
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Higangssh/homebutler/releases/latest/download/homebutler-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o homebutler
chmod +x homebutler

# Run
homebutler status
homebutler docker list
homebutler wake desktop
homebutler ports
```

## Usage

```
homebutler <command> [flags]

Commands:
  status              System status (CPU, memory, disk, uptime)
  docker list         List running containers
  docker restart <n>  Restart a container
  docker stop <n>     Stop a container
  docker logs <n>     Show container logs
  wake <name>         Send Wake-on-LAN packet
  ports               List open ports with process info
  network scan        Discover devices on LAN
  alerts              Show current alert status
  version             Print version

Flags:
  --config <path>     Config file (default: homebutler.yaml)
  --json              Force JSON output
  --server <name>     Target server (planned, default: local)
```

## Configuration

Copy the example config and adjust:

```bash
cp homebutler.example.yaml homebutler.yaml
```

See [homebutler.example.yaml](homebutler.example.yaml) for all options.

## Security

- **No network listener** — homebutler never opens ports or accepts connections
- **Read-only by default** — Status commands don't modify anything
- **Explicit actions only** — Destructive commands require exact container/service names
- **SSH for remote** *(planned)* — Multi-server will use standard SSH (key-based auth recommended)
- **No telemetry** — Zero data collection, zero phone-home

## Use with AI Assistants

homebutler outputs JSON, making it perfect for AI assistants:

```bash
# AI assistant runs this, parses JSON, responds in user's language
homebutler status --json
```

### OpenClaw Skill

An official OpenClaw skill is available:

```bash
openclaw skill install homeserver
```

This lets you manage your homelab from Telegram, Discord, or any chat platform connected to OpenClaw — in any language.
