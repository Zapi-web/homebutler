# homebutler 🏠

**Manage your homelab from Telegram. One binary. Zero dependencies.**

A single-binary CLI that lets you monitor servers, control Docker, wake machines, and scan your network — directly from chat. Built for AI assistants, works great standalone.

## Features

- **System Status** — CPU, memory, disk, uptime at a glance
- **Docker Management** — List, restart, stop, logs for containers
- **Wake-on-LAN** — Power on machines remotely
- **Port Scanner** — See what's listening and which process owns it
- **Network Scan** — Discover devices on your LAN
- **Alerts** — Get notified when resources exceed thresholds
- **Multi-server** — Manage remote servers over SSH (key & password auth)
- **JSON Output** — Pipe-friendly, perfect for AI assistants to parse

## Why homebutler?

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/Higangssh/homebutler@latest

# Or download from releases
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Higangssh/homebutler/releases/latest/download/homebutler-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o homebutler
chmod +x homebutler

# Run
homebutler status
homebutler docker list
homebutler wake desktop
homebutler ports
```

## Usage

```
homebutler <command> [flags]

Commands:
  status              System status (CPU, memory, disk, uptime)
  docker list         List running containers
  docker restart <n>  Restart a container
  docker stop <n>     Stop a container
  docker logs <n>     Show container logs
  wake <name>         Send Wake-on-LAN packet
  ports               List open ports with process info
  network scan        Discover devices on LAN
  alerts              Show current alert status
  deploy              Install homebutler on remote servers
  version             Print version

Flags:
  --json              Force JSON output
  --server <name>     Run on a specific remote server
  --all               Run on all configured servers in parallel
  --local <path>      Use local binary for deploy (air-gapped)
  --config <path>     Config file (auto-detected, see Configuration)
```

## Configuration

homebutler searches for a config file in the following order:

1. `--config <path>` — Explicit flag (highest priority)
2. `$HOMEBUTLER_CONFIG` — Environment variable
3. `~/.config/homebutler/config.yaml` — XDG standard location
4. `./homebutler.yaml` — Current directory

If no config file is found, sensible defaults are used (CPU 90%, memory 85%, disk 90%).

```bash
# Recommended: use XDG location
mkdir -p ~/.config/homebutler
cp homebutler.example.yaml ~/.config/homebutler/config.yaml

# Or use environment variable
export HOMEBUTLER_CONFIG=/path/to/config.yaml

# Or just put it in the current directory
cp homebutler.example.yaml homebutler.yaml
```

See [homebutler.example.yaml](homebutler.example.yaml) for all options.

## Multi-server

Manage multiple servers from a single machine. homebutler connects via SSH and runs the remote homebutler binary to collect data.

### Setup

1. Install homebutler on remote servers:

```bash
# From a machine with internet access:
homebutler deploy --server rpi

# Air-gapped / offline environments:
CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -o homebutler-linux-arm64
homebutler deploy --server rpi --local ./homebutler-linux-arm64
```

2. Configure servers in your config file:

```yaml
servers:
  - name: main-server
    host: 192.168.1.10
    local: true              # This machine

  - name: rpi
    host: 192.168.1.20
    user: pi
    auth: key                # Recommended (default)
    key: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519   # Optional, auto-detects id_ed25519 / id_rsa

  - name: vps
    host: my-vps.example.com
    user: deploy
    port: 2222
    auth: password           # Also supported
    password: "your-password"
```

### SSH Authentication

Both key-based and password-based authentication are supported:

- **Key-based (recommended)** — Set `auth: key` (or omit, it's the default). If `key` is not specified, homebutler tries `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` then `~/.ssh/id_rsa` automatically.
- **Password-based** — Set `auth: password` and provide `password`. Not recommended for production.

To set up key-based auth:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "homebutler"
ssh-copy-id user@remote-host
```

### Usage

```bash
# Query a specific server
homebutler status --server rpi
homebutler alerts --server rpi
homebutler docker list --server rpi

# Query all servers in parallel
homebutler status --all
homebutler alerts --all

# Deploy/update homebutler on remote servers
homebutler deploy --server rpi
homebutler deploy --all
```

## Security

- **No network listener** — homebutler never opens ports or accepts connections
- **Read-only by default** — Status commands don't modify anything
- **Explicit actions only** — Destructive commands require exact container/service names
- **SSH for remote** — Multi-server uses standard SSH (key-based auth recommended)
- **No telemetry** — Zero data collection, zero phone-home

## Use with AI Assistants

homebutler outputs JSON, making it perfect for AI assistants:

```bash
# AI assistant runs this, parses JSON, responds in user's language
homebutler status --json
```

### OpenClaw Skill

An official [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) skill is available on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/skills/homeserver):

```bash
clawhub install homeserver
```

This lets you manage your homelab from Telegram, Discord, or any chat platform connected to OpenClaw — in any language.
